TFBS 0.3.0 
=============
 * TFBS::PatternGen::Gibbs sometimes emits an "unequal column counts"
   warning. This is a result of sporadic roundoff errors due to information 
   loss when converting form Gibbs percentage matrices to PFMs. We are 
   working on a more inteligent conversion procedure, while trying to
   persuade the authors of Gibbs program to include standard PFMs in the 
   program's output.
