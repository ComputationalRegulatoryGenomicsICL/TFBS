Changes in 0.3.1:
================
* Available as two distributions 
	0.3.1s - for use with current stable (0.7.*) release of bioperl
	0.3.1d - for use with development (currently 1.0.alpha) release
	         of bioperl; produced using patches kindly provided by
		 Jason Stajich

* Added POD documentation for 
	* Iterator method in TFBS::MatrixSet,
          TFBS::SiteSet and TFBS::SitePairSet	
	* search_seq and search_aln methods in TFBS::MatrixSet

* TFBS::Matrix::PWM : fixed bug in handling -seqstring parameter
  passed to the search_seq method

* TFBS::Matrix::* : fixed bug in handling -matrixstring parameter
  passed to the constructor



Changes in 0.3.0:
================
* All aggregate classes (TFBS::MatrixSet, TFBS::SiteSet 
  and TFBS::SitePairSet) have iterators with uniform interface.

* added search_aln method to TFBS::MatrixSet, making possible 
  phylogenetic footprinting scans with sets of matrices

* Removed absolute requirement for the GD.pm module: its import is 
  deferred until the first call of draw_logo method of TFBS::Matrix 
  subclasses. Package test suite now does not require it, either.

* Changes in Makefile.PL: it now very clearly notifies user about 
  missing prerequisute modules.
    
*  Improved documentation: added README and CHANGES files, and data 
   model information for JASPAR2 database in TFBS::DB::JASPAR2 POD
    
*  More example scripts included in the distribution (see below)
    
*  Fixed quite a few bugs, mainly in TFBS::DB::FlatFileDir and aggregate 
classes
